# CITCEA

This repository is meant to include various works related to power systems developed during my internship in CITCEA. Right now it contains:

- The computation of VSC operating points under unbalanced faults, looking for the optimal ones. This is the main work under development.
- A program related to the Proper Generalised Decomposition to solve faster the power flow problem. It now works relatively fine (error of about 1e-4 pu).
